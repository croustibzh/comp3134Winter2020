#1 input Ben

Nothing happens (on the display) because Ben doesn't have an active value of 1 in your database so it isnt return by our query.

#2 input Ben'-- 

Ben is returned. "-- " comments our sql code and bypass the validation for field active and return Ben anyway.


#3 input Ben' or 1=1

No results show since Ben' or 1=1 makes our query return with an open single quote (error).
